### Create React App

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

### Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a popular and lightweight framework for **static and server‑rendered applications**built with React. It includes **styling and routing solutions** out of the box, and assumes that you’re using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as the server environment.

Learn Next.js from [its official guide](https://nextjs.org/learn/).

### Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is the best way to create **static websites** with React. It lets you use React components, but outputs pre-rendered HTML and CSS to guarantee the fastest load time.

Learn Gatsby from [its official guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and a [gallery of starter kits](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/).

### More Flexible Toolchains

The following toolchains offer more flexibility and choice. We recommend them to more experienced users:

- **Neutrino** combines the power of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) with the simplicity of presets, and includes a preset for [React apps](https://neutrinojs.org/packages/react/) and [React components](https://neutrinojs.org/packages/react-components/).
- **nwb** is particularly great for [publishing React components for npm](https://github.com/insin/nwb/blob/master/docs/guides/ReactComponents.md#developing-react-components-and-libraries-with-nwb). It [can be used](https://github.com/insin/nwb/blob/master/docs/guides/ReactApps.md#developing-react-apps-with-nwb) for creating React apps, too.
- **Parcel** is a fast, zero configuration web application bundler that [works with React](https://parceljs.org/recipes.html#react).
- **Razzle** is a server-rendering framework that doesn’t require any configuration, but offers more flexibility than Next.js.
